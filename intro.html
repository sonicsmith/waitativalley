<h1>Waitati Valley Equestrian Centre</h1>
<p>
Waitati Valley Equestrian Centre is a newly built equestrian centre on a large section open for casual hire and agistment. We have an all-weather (sand and rubber, full drainage) full-sized out door dressage and jumping arena, jumps, large stables with individual lockable feed and tack sheds, as well as a large communal tack room and feed storage area.<br />
Our deer fenced 50 acres section provides an ample selection of grazing with varied paddocks for varied needs. There is a sheltered stable kitchenette with BBQ, picnic table, and bathroom/shower facilities. We welcome you to come check us out.
